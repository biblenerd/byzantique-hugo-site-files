Cotter, Genesis, ed. Jerome T. Walsh, Chris Franke, and David W. Cotter, Berit Olam Studies in Hebrew Narrative and Poetry (Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 2003), 36. There is further an allusion to priestly service in the clothing, and the potential killing of an animal to provide these garments of skin may also be an allusion to animal sacrifice related to atonement. However, due to verb indicating that God \u0026ldquo;made\u0026rdquo; the garments, he may have created them (i.e., without killing any animal).\nQuote The language of the verse alludes to tabernacle setting and worship. “Garments” (kūttōnet) and “clothed” (lābaš) are reminiscent of the Pentateuch’s description of priestly garments, particularly for Aaron as high priest. This is another lexical link with the symbols of the tabernacle, where the priest must be properly clothed before God in the administration of his service (Exod 20:26; 28:42).\nK. A. Mathews, Genesis 1-11:26, vol. 1A, The New American Commentary (Nashville: Broadman \u0026amp; Holman Publishers, 1996), 254–255.\nGod clothed humanity\u0026rsquo;s nakedness as an act of mercy and does so even further in Christ. \u0026ldquo;For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ\u0026rdquo; (Galatians 3:27, BTV). In Christ, \u0026ldquo;you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its Creator\u0026rdquo; (Colossians 3:9b–10, BTV). \u0026ldquo;I counsel yoʋ to buy from me gold refined by fire so that yoʋ may be rich, and white garments so that yoʋ may clothe yoʋrself and the shame of yoʋr nakedness may not be revealed, and eye salve to anoint yoʋr eyes so that yoʋ may see\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 3:18, BTV). \u0026ldquo;For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 15:53, BTV). Christians are \u0026ldquo;further clothed\u0026rdquo; in Christ and are a \u0026ldquo;new creation.\u0026rdquo; 2 Corinthians 5:1–5, 16–17 (BTV) 1 Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not made by human hands. 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be further clothed with our heavenly dwelling, 3 because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. 4 For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 5 Now he who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has also given us the Spirit as a guarantee\u0026hellip;.\n16 So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, we no longer know him in that way. 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\nQuote Even as God drives Adam and Eve from the garden, however, He provides better clothing for them (v. 21). This is important. Man’s sin created the problem of nakedness, and hence the solution of clothing, as described here in chapter 3. In the Bible’s final book, nonetheless, when man’s sin has in every last sense been conquered, we do not see the human race returned to the nakedness of its primitive, unfallen state. The new man in Christ is clothed. We are described in the Book of Revelation as wearing the white robes of glory. Grace, that is to say, does more than reverse the effects of sin; it transforms the effects of sin. Our new innocence in Christ is not to be identified as simply the earlier innocence of Adam. The effect of sin is not merely removed; it is assumed into a more ample transformation.\nPatrick Henry Reardon, Creation and the Patriarchal Histories: Orthodox Christian Reflections on the Book of Genesis (Chesterton, IN: Ancient Faith Publishing, 2008), 43.\nExpulsion from the Garden 22: The fathers generally indicate that Adam \u0026amp; Even did not receive the knowledge (nor godlike status) promised by the serpent. They also view their banishment from paradise and the tree of life as an act of mercy to prevent them living eternally in suffering and futility.\n24: Humanity was exiled from the presence of God, but God continued to provide means for humans to be in His presence, albeit in limited and provisional ways, until the coming of Christ to provide a path for all God\u0026rsquo;s people. We continue to pray and worship facing the East, awaiting His second and final coming for our full re-entrance to paradise and the tree of life. \u0026ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give the right to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 2:7, BTV).\nQuote The second Adam, Jesus Christ, points out that through the water of the bath of rebirth, the flickering flame—by which the cherubim guardian blocked the entry into paradise when the first Adam was expelled—would be extinguished. Where the one went out with his wife, having been conquered by his enemy, there the other might return with his spouse (namely, the church of the saints), as a conqueror over his enemy.\nVenerable Bede, \u0026ldquo;Homilies on the Gospels\u0026rdquo; 1.12, in Andrew Louth and Marco Conti, eds., Genesis 1–11, Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2001), 102.\nSt. Ephrem the Syrian associated the sword guarding the tree of life with the spear that pierced Jesus\u0026rsquo; side in John 19:34: Christ \u0026ldquo;was pierced and so removed the sword from the entry to Paradise\u0026rdquo; (Hymns on Paradise 2.1). Quote John 19:34 is a key verse for St. Ephrem’s symbolic theology, seeing that it serves as a focal point for a great deal of his typological exegesis. The lance and the side of Christ, the Second Adam, both point back to the Genesis narrative, to the cherub’s sword and to the First Adam’s side which gave miraculous birth to Eve. The side of Christ, whence issue—or flow—water and blood, also looks forward to the Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist, and, at the same time, to the equally miraculous birth of the Church.\nSt. Ephrem, Hymns on Paradise, trans. Sebastian Brock, Popular Patristics Series (Crestwood, NY: St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1990), 64–65.\nQuote Apparently then, man did not die on the day he ate of the tree. But in the closing verses of the chapter, sanctuary symbolism and language reappear (3:21–24). God clothes the human couple and then expels them through the east-facing entrance to the garden where cherubim are stationed to guard the tree of life. These features anticipate the design of the tabernacle and the regulations associated with it. Like the garden of Eden, the tabernacle was a place where God walked with his people. To be expelled from the camp of Israel or to be rejected by God was to experience a living death; in both situations gestures of mourning were appropriate (Lev 13:45–46; Num 5:2–4; 1 Sam 15:35). The psalmists, too, held that in the house of God men could “drink from the river of the delights [עדן], for with thee is the fountain of life” (Ps 36:9–10 [8–9]). Only in the presence of God did man enjoy fullness of life. To choose anything else is to choose death (Prov 8:36). The expulsion from the garden of delight where God himself lived would therefore have been regarded by the godly men of ancient Israel as yet more catastrophic than physical death. The latter was the ultimate sign and seal of the spiritual death the human couple experienced on the day they ate from the forbidden tree\u0026hellip;.\nThe symbolic dimensions of the story linking the garden with the later sanctuaries support a paradigmatic reading. Water, gold, jewels, cherubim and so on link the garden of Eden with the tabernacle and temples described later. The curses pronounced on the guilty for disobeying the divine instructions anticipate those pronounced on those who disregard the law. These elements give the story a universalistic flavor, or at least a pan-Israelite setting. “Adam” is every man in Israel.\nGordon J. Wenham, Genesis 1–15, vol. 1, Word Biblical Commentary (Dallas: Word, Incorporated, 1987), 90, 91.\nThe First Children (4:1–7) Translation Genesis 4:1–7 (ENGLXXUP), altered 1 And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain and said, I have gained a man through God. 2 And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3 And it was so after some time that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth [an offeringa] to the Lord. 4 And Abel also brought of the firstborn of his sheep and of his fatlings, and God looked upon Abel and his gifts, 5 but Cain and his sacrifices he regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful and his countenance fell. 6 And the Lord God said to Cain, Why art thou become very sorrowful and why is thy countenance fallen? 7 Hast thou not sinned if thou hast brought it rightly, but not rightly divided it? Beb still, to thee shall be his [recoursec], and thou shalt rule over him.\na Brenton / ENGLXXUP translated θυσίαν as \u0026ldquo;a sacrifice.\u0026rdquo;\nb Brenton / ENGLXXUP did not capitalize \u0026ldquo;be\u0026rdquo; following the question mark.\nc Brenton / ENGLXXUP translated ἀποστροφή as \u0026ldquo;submission.\u0026rdquo;\nNotes 1: The serpent promised that Eve would know good and evil. Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge and knew they were naked. And now, Adam knew his wife, Eve. The fathers discussed coitus as a form of knowledge and a practice that began after the Fall, but are somewhat divided on this.\nThe Hebrew has a wordplay (assonance) between \u0026ldquo;Cain\u0026rdquo; (קַיִן / qayin) and \u0026ldquo;gained\u0026rdquo; (קָנִ֥יתִי / qaniti). To retain some similarity in sound (homonymy) between the words, I\u0026rsquo;ve retained Brenton\u0026rsquo;s translation of \u0026ldquo;gained\u0026rdquo; rather than opt for \u0026ldquo;acquired\u0026rdquo; which might be a slightly clearer translation. Cain\u0026rsquo;s name might mean \u0026ldquo;smith\u0026rdquo; in the sense of \u0026ldquo;blacksmith,\u0026rdquo; but this is uncertain.\nThere are a number of parallels between this account and that of Adam and Eve in chapter 3, including patterns and similar language, with some notable contrasts indicating humanity is falling further away from God.\n2: The Hebrew name \u0026ldquo;Abel\u0026rdquo; (הֶבֶל / Hevel) means \u0026ldquo;breath,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;vapor,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;emptiness.\u0026rdquo; This is the same word used throughout the book of Ecclesiastes (Qohelet) which is frequently translated as \u0026ldquo;vanity.\u0026rdquo;\n3: Some unspecified period of time has passed—at least enough for Cain and Abel to grow older. The Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;offering\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;gift\u0026rdquo; (מִנְחָה / minḥah) may imply a grain offering (cf. Leviticus 2), but does not preclude animal sacrifice.\n5: The verb λυπέω (lypeō) is (correctly) translated as \u0026ldquo;exceedingly sorrowful,\u0026rdquo; but the Hebrew חרה (ḥarah) refers to anger, which is also the sense understood by many of the fathers.\n5: There is a lot of speculation amongst the fathers and other commentators about why Abel\u0026rsquo;s gift was regarded but Cain\u0026rsquo;s was not. Theories include:\nThe common theme in Genesis of subverting primogeniture.\nCain did not offer the best/firstfruits whereas Abel did. This is suggested by the contrast between Abel offering from his \u0026ldquo;firstborn\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;fatlings\u0026rdquo; with no corresponding terms applied to Cain\u0026rsquo;s offering. It also appears to be the understanding of the author of Hebrews: \u0026ldquo;By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous when God gave approval to his gifts. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead\u0026rdquo; (Hebrews 11:4, BTV).\nCain\u0026rsquo;s attitude / heart was wrong, whereas Abel truly offered to God from a position of gratitude.\nA greater regard for herdsmen (shepherding/pastoral work) than for farmers (agricultural work).\n2–5: Several commentators have noted a chiastic structure in these verses:\nAbel, Cain Cain, Abel Abel, Cain 7: This is the first mention of sin in the Bible.\n","description":"Exiled from Paradise (3:21–3:24) Translation Notes God clothed Adam and Eve Expulsion from the Garden The First Children (4:1–7) Translation Notes Lectionary 2nd Monday of Great Lent This entire pericope (3:21–4:7) is read during Vespers on the second Monday of Great Lent, but it has been subdivided on this page for the purpose of providing more organized commentary.\nExiled from Paradise (3:21–3:24) Translation Genesis 3:21–24 (ENGLXXUP), altered 21 And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin, and clothed them."},{"id":1,"href":"/ot/pentateuch/genesis/2/20/","title":"Creation of Eve \u0026 The Fall (Genesis 2:20–3:20)","parent":"Genesis","content":" Creation of Eve (Zoe / Life) (2:20–24) Translation Notes The serpent and the Fall of humanity (3:1–20) Translation Notes Lectionary 1st Friday of Great Lent This entire pericope (2:20–3:20) is read during Vespers on the first Friday of Great Lent, but it has been subdivided on this page for the purpose of providing more organized commentary.\nCreation of Eve (Zoe / Life) (2:20–24) Translation Genesis 2:20–25 (ENGLXXUP), altered 20 And Adam gave names to all the cattle and to all the birds of the sky, and to all the wild beasts of the field, but for Adam there was not found a help like to himself. 21 And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh instead thereof. 22 And God formed the rib which he took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam. 23 And Adam said,\nThis now is bone of my bones,\nand flesh of my flesh;\nshe shall be called woman,\nbecause she was taken out of her [mana].b\n24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 25 And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.\na Brenton / ENGLXXUP translated ἀνδρὸς (andros) as \u0026ldquo;husband.\u0026rdquo;\nb I\u0026rsquo;ve here changed the layout to reflect that Adam\u0026rsquo;s song/poem is poetic.\nNotes 20: Augustine and other fathers believed the primary way in which Eve was a help to Adam was her ability to bear children (cf. On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis 9.5.9). However, others believed that Adam and Eve lived in virginity prior to the Fall so look to other attributes in which she was his help.\n21: The fathers discuss God\u0026rsquo;s mercy in causing Adam to sleep so as to not feel any pain during this process. Contemporary commentators have speculated that Adam being asleep emphasizes God\u0026rsquo;s creative role in the creation of woman—Adam contributed part of himself but personally was not any kind of co-creator of woman.\n21–22: Just as Eve had no earthly mother, Jesus had no earthly father.\nQuote \u0026ldquo;Of whom was Eve begotten in the beginning? What mother conceived her who had no mother?\u0026rdquo; But Scripture says she was born from Adam’s side. Now then, if Eve was born, without a mother, from the side of a man, may not a child be born, without a man, from the womb of a virgin? A debt of gratitude was due from womankind; for Eve was begotten of Adam, not conceived of a mother, but, as it were, brought forth from man alone. Mary, then, paid the debt of gratitude when, not of man, but immaculately of her own self, she conceived of the Holy Spirit by the power of God.\nCyril of Jerusalem, The Works of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, ed.

I altered Brenton\u0026rsquo;s (ENGLXXUP) translation herein to maintain the wordplay. With that said, Brenton\u0026rsquo;s original translation of \u0026ldquo;husband\u0026rdquo; is probably a more appropriate translation of ἀνδρὸς (andros) in context.\nThe first recorded words of Adam are his song/poem in praise of woman. Quote [T]he woman was made of a rib out of the side of Adam; not made out of his head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be beloved.\nMatthew Henry, Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible: Complete and Unabridged in One Volume (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1994), 10.\n23–24: St. Paul alludes to Adam\u0026rsquo;s song/poem and calls this union as one flesh a \u0026ldquo;profound mystery,\u0026rdquo; but relates this relationship between husband and wife to that between Christ and His Church, respectively (Ephesians 5:30–32). Also, just as a husband must leave his parents and \u0026ldquo;cleave\u0026rdquo; to his wife, Jesus (in a sense) left the Father (becoming human) to find and redeem His Bride, the Church. The fathers frequently comment on marriage as an example of the relationship between Jesus and the Church.\nThe fathers also commented on the process of God removing Adam\u0026rsquo;s rib, and some fathers believe God caused him to dream for the first time during this process, whereas others focus on the wound on Jesus\u0026rsquo; side compared to the \u0026ldquo;wound\u0026rdquo; of removing Adam\u0026rsquo;s rib.\nRobert Alter commented on man\u0026rsquo;s pursuit of woman \u0026ldquo;to regain a lost part of himself.\u0026rdquo;\n25: The fathers indicate that Adam and Eve were clothed in glory prior to the Fall, but then this glory was stripped away from them and they wore a garment of sin. This brought about shame and hence awareness of their nakedness. The fathers connected their nakedness to the baptismal practice in the early Church of entering the water naked.\nQuote After the anointing, then, it remains to go into the bath of sacred waters. After stripping you of your robe, the priest himself leads you down into the flowing waters. But why naked? He reminds you of your former nakedness, when you were in Paradise and you were not ashamed. For Holy Writ says: Adam and Eve were naked and were not ashamed, until they took up the garment of sin, a garment heavy with abundant shame.\nDo not, then, feel shame here, for the bath is much better than the garden of Paradise. There can be no serpent here, but Christ is here initiating you into the regeneration that comes from the water and the Spirit. You cannot see here beautiful trees and fruits, but you can see spiritual favors. You cannot find here the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, nor law and commandments, but you can find grace and gifts. For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under the Law but under grace [(Romans 6:14)].\nSt. John Chrysostom, St. John Chrysostom: Baptismal Instructions, ed.

However, the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (nachash) could potentially also have been understood in other ways (not to imply that it should be translated differently, but that an ancient reader might have had these connections in mind within their \u0026ldquo;cognitive framework\u0026rdquo;). The implication is that an ancient reader would have known the \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; was a divine being that gave an omen to Eve—the account would not have been (mis)understood as a fairy tale about a talking snake. Additional semantic domains of the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (nachash) in addition to its primary sense as \u0026ldquo;serpent\u0026rdquo; include:\nThe verbal root (binyan) נחשׁ (n-ch-sh) of the noun means \u0026ldquo;to seek and tell omens, foretell\u0026rdquo; and so refers to divination (HALOT 2000, 690).\nLuminescent / brazen, as it pertains to copper / bronze (related by the binyan (נחשׁ) of נְחֹשֶׁת / nechoshet). See also the reference to the city of Nachash in 1 Chronicles 4:12, which implies a city of copper / bronze smiths. Copper / bronze is used in descriptions of divine beings as well (cf. Daniel 10:6 in the MT). The emphasis on \u0026ldquo;shining\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;luminescence\u0026rdquo; may be a bit of a stretch in my opinion, but the connection to copper / bronze is clear both in Hebrew and Aramaic.\nCf.

St. Ephrem the Syrian also taught that the animals could not enter paradise, so Adam and Eve had to go outside the garden to meet with the serpent. In the previously referenced hymn, he expresses that the serpent only learned of God\u0026rsquo;s prohibition to Adam and Eve concerning the tree of knowledge through prior conversation. Whereas some contemporary commentators believe that Eve exaggerated God\u0026rsquo;s prohibition by saying they were not even to touch the tree, several of the fathers went further to indicate that Adam and Eve were not even supposed to look at the tree lest they be enticed by its beauty (cf., e.g., St. Ephrem the Syrian, Commentary on Genesis 2.20.1). St. Ephrem indicated that the tree of knowledge served \u0026ldquo;as a boundary to the inner region of Paradise\u0026hellip;. [and] that it was not lawful to penetrate further, beyond that Tree.\u0026rdquo;\nSt. Ephrem, Hymns on Paradise, trans. Sebastian Brock, Popular Patristics Series (Crestwood, NY: St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1990), 91 (3.3). 3: St. Ambrose indicated that God only spoke directly to Adam, whereas Eve learned of the prohibition concerning the tree from her husband. Thus, the serpent\u0026rsquo;s temptation of Eve was a means of circumventing Adam (On Paradise 12 (333)).\n5: The LXX indicates that if Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, they will be \u0026ldquo;as gods\u0026rdquo; (ὡς θεοί / hos theoi), which corresponds to the Hebrew הְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽאלֹהִ֔ים (heyitem k\u0026rsquo;elohim; i.e. \u0026ldquo;like the gods\u0026rdquo;). However, the gramatically plural elohim is generally translated in the singular, so English translations of the Hebrew often render this \u0026ldquo;like God.\u0026rdquo;\n6: Note that Adam was \u0026ldquo;with her,\u0026rdquo; yet did not protest, and he also chose to eat the forbidden fruit. Eve chose to listen to the serpent\u0026rsquo;s (re)interpretation of God\u0026rsquo;s word. \u0026ldquo;Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: For if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee\u0026rdquo; (Wisdom of Sirach [Ecclesiasticus] 21:2a, ENGLXXUP). By listening to the serpent instead of to God, \u0026ldquo;they exchanged the truth of God for falsehood and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator\u0026rdquo; (Romans 1:25, BTV).\nQuote In this account, Eve is faced with two interpretations of reality\u0026hellip;. One interpretation of this fruit and why it was forbidden was given by God, Who created Eve and everything else, and another one was given by the serpent, a fellow creature\u0026hellip;.\nEve, we could say, at this point decides that all that matters is the \u0026ldquo;text\u0026rdquo; alone—the two interpretations or statements made—along with how things look on the surface to her own eyes, which is only the superficial, physical reality. Apparently she doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop to consider who it is giving each interpretation, and what her relationship is with each interpreter. Like many modern-day commentators, she thinks that interpretation can be impersonal, \u0026ldquo;objective.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t ask God about this,\u0026rdquo; the serpent implies; \u0026ldquo;He is not trustworthy. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t really love you. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t really want the best for you.\u0026rdquo; Then he implies, \u0026ldquo;And don\u0026rsquo;t ask Adam, either. Judge for yourself—you don\u0026rsquo;t need others to help you discern the truth.\u0026rdquo;\nThe fruit really is beautiful. It looks good to Eve, and what the serpent says seems reasonable to her \u0026ldquo;unaided reason,\u0026rdquo; so she decides to accept the interpretation he offers, and to act on his statement—an action which the serpent implies she can make completely independently. However, Eve doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize that in choosing the serpent\u0026rsquo;s interpretation, and in acting with her supposed autonomy, she in fact chooses communion with the serpent over, and instead of, communion with God and her husband.\nMary S. Ford, The Soul\u0026rsquo;s Longing: An Orthodox Christian Perspective on Biblical Interpretation (Waymart, Pennsylvania: St. Tikhon\u0026rsquo;s Monastery Press, 2015), 50–51.\n6: The fathers taught that Adam and Eve\u0026rsquo;s pride and avarice led to their Fall. \u0026ldquo;Pride goes before destruction, And folly before a fall\u0026rdquo; (Proverbs 16:18, ENGLXXUP). St. Augustine taught that since humanity\u0026rsquo;s downfall came about through pride, our path to restoration is the way of humility (\u0026ldquo;Faith and the Creed\u0026rdquo; 4.6 in On Christian Belief).\nIndeed, Eve\u0026rsquo;s temptation serves as an example of how humans are tempted, summarized in 1 John 2:16: \u0026ldquo;For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father, but from the world\u0026rdquo; (BTV). Eve\u0026rsquo;s reasoning is distorted and darkened by her passions, and she entertains the serpent\u0026rsquo;s temptation and enters into dialog with his tempting counsel. Genesis 3:6 Excerpt (ENGLXXUP \u0026 WEB) 1 John 2:16 Excerpt (BTV) And the woman saw that the tree was good for food the lust of the flesh and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to contemplate the lust of the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise\nThis statement is only present in the Hebrew MT and not in the Greek LXX. This is from the WEB translation. and the pride of life After illustrating the above comparison between Genesis 3:6 and 1 John 2:16, Fr. Reardon points out that, \u0026ldquo;St. Paul describes Eve’s beguilement as a corruption from \u0026lsquo;simplicity\u0026rsquo; (2 Corinthians 11:3). In place of God’s emphatic command, known solely through the moral tradition available to her, Eve declared the autonomy of her own thought, not pausing to consider that her thinking was hardly more than the perverse assertion of her passions.\u0026rdquo;\nPatrick Henry Reardon, Creation and the Patriarchal Histories: Orthodox Christian Reflections on the Book of Genesis (Chesterton, IN: Ancient Faith Publishing, 2008), 41–42. St. Irenaus pointed to Mary\u0026rsquo;s obedience beginning the process of undoing what Eve\u0026rsquo;s disobedience had brought about, and likewise Christ\u0026rsquo;s obedience undoing Adam\u0026rsquo;s disobedience:\nQuote That the Lord then was manifestly coming to His own things, and was sustaining them by means of that creation which is supported by Himself, and was making a recapitulation of that disobedience which had occurred in connection with a tree, through the obedience which was [exhibited by Himself when He hung] upon a tree, [the effects] also of that deception being done away with, by which that virgin Eve, who was already espoused to a man, was unhappily misled,—was happily announced, through means of the truth [spoken] by the angel to the Virgin Mary, who was [also espoused] to a man. For just as the former was led astray by the word of an angel, so that she fled from God when she had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic communication, receive the glad tidings that she should sustain (portaret) God, being obedient to His word. And if the former did disobey God, yet the latter was persuaded to be obedient to God, in order that the Virgin Mary might become the patroness (advocata) of the virgin Eve. And thus, as the human race fell into bondage to death by means of a virgin, so is it rescued by a virgin; virginal disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal obedience.\nIrenaeus of Lyons, “Irenæus against Heresies,” in The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe, vol. 1, The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Company, 1885), 547 (5.19.1).\n7: The serpent promised that if the forbidden fruit was eaten, Adam and Eve \u0026ldquo;would be as gods, knowing [γινώσκοντες / ginōskontes] good and evil\u0026rdquo; (v. 5). Once they had eaten, they knew [ἔγνωσαν / egnōsan] they were naked\u0026quot; (both words are forms of the same Greek verb meaning \u0026ldquo;to know\u0026rdquo; (γινώσκω / ginōskō). I altered the above translation to make the usage of the same verb in vv. 5 and 7 apparent.\nConcerning the fig leaves, Rashi wrote: \u0026ldquo;This was the tree of which they had eaten; by the very thing through which their ruin had been caused was some improvement effected in their condition.\u0026rdquo; In contrast. St. Ephrem indicated that Adam actually left paradise: \u0026ldquo;he ran off and took refuge among the modest fig trees.\u0026rdquo;\nSt. Ephrem, Hymns on Paradise, trans. Sebastian Brock, Popular Patristics Series (Crestwood, NY: St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1990), 95 (3.13). The fathers taught that although humanity\u0026rsquo;s downfall came about by means of a tree (of the knowledge of good and evil), so also did its redemption (on the cross).\nThe desire for deification (theosis: truly becoming \u0026ldquo;like God\u0026rdquo;) is not the problem (this was in fact God\u0026rsquo;s intention for Adam and Eve and for all humanity), but rather the means by which they attempted to obtain it via a shortcut. Instead of pursuing theosis through obedience, they were disobedient and attempted to obtain it on their own terms. They then were exposed to knowledge that they weren\u0026rsquo;t yet mature enough to receive.\nThis is a pervasive theme in later geneaological lists, standing in contrast to ANE perspectives that receiving knowledge from divine beings was a good thing. The Old Testament Scriptures instead point to the other divine beings as prematurely bringing knowledge to humanity that it was not mature enough to receive, resulting in the undoing of creation (descent into further chaos and death rather than order and life). Quote [T]he tree of knowledge was not planted originally with any evil intent, nor was it forbidden in a spirit of jealousy. Let not the enemies of God make any such suggestion or think to imitate the serpent. On the contrary, it was good if eaten at the right time; for as I understand it, the fruit was contemplation, which is only safely attempted by those who have attained a more perfect state. But it was not good for those at a lower stage of development, \u0026hellip; just as mature food is not profitable for those of tender years who still need milk.\nSt. Gregory the Theologian, Oration 45:8 on Easter; excerpt quoted in Panayiotis Nellas, Deification in Christ: The Nature of the Human Person (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir\u0026rsquo;s Seminary Press, 1987), 204.\n8: Several fathers comment on the time of day, making the point that the sun was now setting for Adam and Eve (literally and metaphorically).\nI find it curious that they hid \u0026ldquo;in the middle of the tree of the garden\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ ξύλου τοῦ παραδείσου\u0026rdquo;). The tree of life is described in 2:9 as \u0026ldquo;the tree of life in the middle of the garden\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;τὸ ξύλον τῆς ζωῆς ἐν μέσῳ τῷ παραδείσῳ\u0026rdquo;). Perhaps the implication in the LXX is that they hid within the tree of life in an attempt to avoid death—the promised consequence of their transgression.\nCaveat: In the Hebrew, the use of the gramatically singular \u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo; can refer to a plurality of trees (עֵץ / ēts is a collective noun). In Greek, ξύλον (xylon) means \u0026ldquo;wood,\u0026rdquo; and so it may perhaps also be used as a collective noun for trees, as translated by Brenton / ENGLXXUP. With that said, in support of translating ξύλον (xylon) as the singular \u0026ldquo;tree,\u0026rdquo; the LES also translated this \u0026ldquo;in the middle of the tree of the garden\u0026rdquo; and the OSB translated it \u0026ldquo;within the tree in the middle of the garden.\u0026rdquo; I hence offer this only as a qualified observation—I am unsure—but I am not alone in translating it as singular (\u0026ldquo;tree\u0026rdquo;). 9: The fathers emphasize God\u0026rsquo;s patience and mercy in calling for Adam, giving him an opportunity for repentance.\n11: God\u0026rsquo;s follow-up question further demonstrates his patience and mercy. Instead of responding in anger, God asked a question, but also made it clear that He knew what had happened. Instead of humbling himself, Adam responded by pointing the finger at God and at Eve.\n12: Adam begins a cascading blame game that destroys the relationships between God and humanity, the marital relationship, the relationship between humanity and creation itself, and even the relationship within one\u0026rsquo;s own soul/self (e.g., shame). When Adam accused both God and his wife instead of accepting responsibility for his free choice to disobey God, he broke both relationships in a single sentence. Rather than simply saying “Yes” when God asked if he had eaten from the forbidden tree, Adam replied to God, “The woman You gave me, gave me of the tree, and I ate.” Note both accusations: “The woman” (blaming Eve) whom “You gave me” (blaming God).\n13: Whereas Adam blamed Eve and God for what was given to him (the fruit and the woman, respectively), Eve indicated that she had been deceived by the serpent. God also mercifully gave her an opportunity to repent, and patiently asked her a question rather than expressing an angry response.\n14: There is a contrast between vv. 1 and 14, on which Rashi commented, \u0026ldquo;Corresponding with his subtleness and his greatness was his downfall; \u0026lsquo;more subtle than all\u0026rsquo; — \u0026lsquo;more cursed than all\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;:\n3:1: \u0026ldquo;Now the serpent was the most crafty of all the brutes on the earth\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; 3:14: \u0026ldquo;Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and all the brutes of the earth\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; 14: God does not question the serpent nor respond with patience and mercy to it. God responds to all three parties in reverse order of the blame game: first the serpent, then Eve, and finally Adam.\nWhereas the Hebrew MT records God\u0026rsquo;s curse on the serpent as \u0026ldquo;upon your belly you shall go,\u0026rdquo; the LXX adds \u0026ldquo;on your chest and belly you shall go\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;ἐπὶ τῷ στήθει σου καὶ τῇ κοιλίᾳ πορεύσῃ\u0026rdquo;), perhaps to emphasize that the entire underside of the serpent is intended. 15: The Protoevangelium: The fathers emphasize that Eve\u0026rsquo;s seed being referred to here is Jesus.\nNote that only the serpent and the ground are cursed (v. 17)—Adam and Eve were not cursed (the first human cursed by God is Cain in 4:11). 16: Whereas in 1:28, God blessed them, saying \u0026ldquo;Increase and multiply\u0026hellip;,\u0026rdquo; He now pronounces that \u0026ldquo;I will greatly multiply thy pains and thy groanings\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; The Hebrew MT and Greek LXX have the same verb in both of these passages. The implication for both Adam and Eve is that their role as God\u0026rsquo;s image-bearers has become more challenging. Eve will now experience suffering when striving to fulfill her roles as mother and wife.\nBrenton / ENGLXXUP translated ἀποστροφή as \u0026ldquo;submission,\u0026rdquo; which I changed to \u0026ldquo;recourse.\u0026rdquo; However, the Hebrew תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) is perhaps better translated \u0026ldquo;longing,\u0026rdquo; which appears to be the sense understood by several of the fathers. Quote [T]he traditional rendering is \u0026ldquo;desire\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; Some ancient translations of Genesis understood the word to mean \u0026ldquo;desire\u0026rdquo; (e.g. Symmachus, Gen[esis] 4:7 Vulg[ate]). Most, however, understood it to mean \u0026ldquo;turning\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;returning,\u0026rdquo; as in the rendering of the Septuagint: \u0026ldquo;and to your husband shall be your returning\u0026rdquo; [(translated herein as \u0026ldquo;recourse\u0026rdquo;)]. That more prevalent rendering has often been explained as being based on a misreading, since the rare word used here differs by only one letter from a common word that means \u0026ldquo;returning\u0026rdquo; (teshuḇah). The usage of teshuqah in the ancient manuscripts found at Qumran, however, suggests that \u0026ldquo;desire\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;turning\u0026rdquo; is a false choice. Given the limited number of occurrences, the matter is not certain, but the word seems to have the sense of impetus or movement with the connotation of desire. The best English equivalent would therefore be \u0026ldquo;longing\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; This understanding of the word makes it unlikely that the preposition has an adversarial sense, as in ESV: \u0026ldquo;Your desire shall be contrary to your husband.\u0026rdquo;\nSamuel L. Bray and John F. Hobbins, Genesis 1-11: A New Old Translation for Readers, Scholars, and Translators (Wilmore, KY: GlossaHouse, 2017), 120.\nSt. John Chrysostom saw this \u0026ldquo;longing\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;yearning\u0026rdquo;) for her husband as part of God\u0026rsquo;s mercy to women: Quote As if to explain his reasons to the woman, the loving God said this, meaning, In the beginning I created you equal in esteem to your husband, and my intention was that in everything you would share with him as an equal, and as I entrusted control of everything to your husband, so did I to you; but you abused your equality of status. Hence I subject you to your husband: “ ‘Your yearning will be for your husband, and he will be your master.’ ” Because you abandoned your equal, who was sharer with you in the same nature \u0026hellip; and for whom you were created, and you chose to enter into conversation with that evil creature the serpent, and to take the advice he had to give, accordingly I now subject you to him in future and designate him as your master for you to recognize his lordship, and since you did not know how to rule, learn well how to be ruled. “ ‘Your yearning will be for your husband, and he will be your master.’ ” It is better that you be subject to him and fall under his lordship than that enjoying freedom and authority, you would be cast into the abyss. It would be more useful also for a horse to carry the bit and travel under direction than without this to fall down a cliff. Accordingly, considering what is advantageous, I want you to have yearning for him and, like a body being directed by its head, to recognize his lordship pleasurably.\nJohn Chrysostom, Homilies on Genesis 1–17, ed. Thomas P. Halton, trans. Robert C. Hill, vol. 74, The Fathers of the Church (Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 1986), 240–241 (17.36).\n17–19: Adam\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;sentence\u0026rdquo; is the longest of the three. God cursed the ground. The sins of leaders often result in the bitterness and rebellion of their insubordinates. Likewise, creation itself now rebels against man due to his sin—our own bodies included. Quote Before the fall, all things were subject to the control of man, because God had made him ruler over all the things on the earth and in the water\u0026hellip;. At that time the earth brought forth of itself fruits for the use of the animals that were subject to man, and there were neither violent rains upon the earth nor wintry storms. But, after the fall, ‘when he was compared to senseless beasts, and was become like to them,’ [(Psalm 48:13)] and when he had caused the unreasoning desire within himself to prevail over his rational intellect and had become disobedient to the commandment of the Lord, then the creation subject to him rose up against this ruler appointed by the Creator, and he was ordered to work in the sweat of his face the earth from which he had been taken.\nJohn Damascene, \u0026ldquo;An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith,\u0026rdquo; in Writings, ed. Hermigild Dressler, trans. Frederic H. Chase Jr., vol. 37, The Fathers of the Church (Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 1958), 228–229 (2.10).\n18: Tertullian drew a connection between the thorns and thistles due to God\u0026rsquo;s curse on the ground and the crown of thorns worn by Jesus, which then began the process of undoing the curse: Quote What sort of garland, however, I pray you, did He who is the Head of the man and the glory of the woman, Christ Jesus, the Husband of the church, submit to in behalf of both sexes? Of thorns, I think, and thistles,—a figure of the sins which the soil of the flesh brought forth for us, but which the power of the cross removed, blunting, in its endurance by the head of our Lord, death’s every sting.\nTertullian, “The Chaplet, or De Corona,” in Latin Christianity: Its Founder, Tertullian, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe, vol. 3, The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Company, 1885), 102 (On the Crown (De Corona) 14.3).\n19: The pronouncement of mortality. The fathers make it clear that this was the result of humanity\u0026rsquo;s choice. Humans chose death and so brought it about by their free choice. Death was not a punishment imposed on humanity by God. Quote From what source did death come to Adam? Was it from the nature of a tree of this sort or actually from God? If we ascribe this to the nature of the tree, then the fruit of this tree seems to be superior to the vivifying power of the breath of God, since its fruit had drawn into death\u0026rsquo;s toils him on whom the divine breath had bestowed life. If we maintain that God is the responsible cause of death, then we can be held to accuse Him of inconsistency. We seem to accuse Him of being so devoid of beneficence as to be unwilling to pardon when He had the power to do so, or of being powerless if He was unable to forgive. Let us see, therefore, how this question can be resolved. The solution, unless I am mistaken, lies in the fact that, since disobedience was the cause of death, for that very reason, not God, but man himself, was the agent of his own death. If, for example, a physician were to prescribe to a patient what he thought should be avoided, and if the patient felt that these prohibitions were unnecessary, the physician is not responsible for the patient\u0026rsquo;s death. Surely in that case the patient is guilty of causing his own death. Hence, God as a good physician forbade Adam to eat what would be injurious to him.\nSt. Ambrose, On Paradise 7.35 (313).\n\u0026ldquo;Therefore, [even] as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, death passed to everyone, because {of which} all sinned\u0026rdquo; (Romans 5:12, EOB).\n20: Whereas Adam named the creatures he ruled over in 2:20, he had not named his wife because she was his equal (cf. St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on Genesis 17.36). However, now that they have fallen and Eve has been subjected to Adam, he now names her as he previously did the animals. Her name points to hope for how humanity will now continue through childbearing, albeit with pain and suffering.\nI herein refer to the traditional name \u0026ldquo;Eve\u0026rdquo; (חַוָּה / Havvah) despite the LXX (appropriately) using Ζωή (Zoe, meaning \u0026ldquo;Life\u0026rdquo;) in this pericope. She is later called Eve (Εὕαν) beginning in 4:1 (LXX). The Hebrew חַוָּה (Havvah) was etymologically related to חָֽי (hey, \u0026ldquo;the living\u0026rdquo;), which is retained in the Greek LXX: Ζωή (Zoe = \u0026ldquo;Life\u0026rdquo;) is the mother of the ζώντων (Zoōntōn = \u0026ldquo;living\u0026rdquo;).

I considered translating ἀβύσσου (abyssou) as \u0026ldquo;underworld\u0026rdquo; for this reason, but decided against it to avoid confusion with Hades / Sheol.\nTimothy Michael Law, When God Spoke Greek: The Septuagint and the Making of the Christian Bible (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013), 40. 1–3: The fathers emphasize the role of Jesus (and the entire Trinity) in creation. \u0026ldquo;For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions, rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together\u0026rdquo; (Colossians 1:16–17, BTV).\nThe Nicene Creed further affirms Jesus\u0026rsquo; role in creation: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; by whom all things were made.\u0026rdquo; 5: Most translations say \u0026ldquo;first day\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;one day,\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;ἡμέρα μία\u0026rdquo; (hēmera mia) is better translated as the latter. \u0026ldquo;μία\u0026rdquo; (mia) is a cardinal number (meaning \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo;), whereas \u0026ldquo;πρῶτος\u0026rdquo; (protos) would be the ordinal number (meaning \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo;). For the other days of creation, the ordinal numbers are used, making this distinction intentional and important, and it is present in the Hebrew (יֹ֥ום אֶחָֽד / yom echad), Greek (ἡμέρα μία / hēmera mia), and even in the Latin Vulgate (dies unus). This distinction was the subject of several ancient Jewish (e.g., Philo, Rashi) and Christian (e.g., Sts. Basil and Augustine) commentaries.\nQuote In those ancient and classical commentaries on this biblical text, moreover, we find the common assertion that the words “one day” served to elevate that day of Creation to something more than part of a sequence. There is a profound reason why the original day of Creation is appropriately called “one,” whereas the second day is not appropriately called “two,” nor the third day “three,” and so forth. The original day is “one” in a manner analogous to the number itself. “One” is not simply the numeral that precedes two; it is, rather, the number out of which that second number comes. There is a formal disparity between one and the other numbers. One (to hen) is the font determining the identity of two and the subsequent numbers. “One” is not just “first” as part of a sequence; it is what we call a principle, an arche. On “day one,” then, God creates light, which He thereby separates from darkness. It is out of this light, which is the product of God’s first creating word, that all the rest of Creation comes. All things that God makes are filled with His light. God’s light lies shining at the heart of the world\nPatrick Henry Reardon, Creation and the Patriarchal Histories: Orthodox Christian Reflections on the Book of Genesis (Chesterton, IN: Ancient Faith Publishing, 2008), 32–33.\nThis theme of the \u0026ldquo;one day\u0026rdquo; was also associated with the eighth day (Sunday) and connected to the Orthodox liturgical calendar (specifically, Pentecost in the below example). St. Basil explained why the Church teaches to stand in prayer on Sunday: Quote We say our prayers standing on the first day of the week, but not all know the reason why. By standing for prayer we remind ourselves of the grace given to us on the day of the resurrection, as if we are rising to stand with Christ and being bound to seek what is above. Not only this, it also seems somehow to be an image of the age to come. On account of this, although it is the beginning of days, Moses names it not “first” but “one.” For it is written, “There was evening, and there was morning, one day” (Gen 1:5), as if the same one often repeated. Now, “One” and “Eighth” are the same, which indicates of itself that the really “one” and true “eighth”—which the Psalmist mentions in some titles of psalms—are the state after this time, the unceasing, unending, perpetual day, that never-ending and ever-young age. Necessarily, then, the Church teaches her foster children to pray standing on this day, so that we would not neglect the provisions for our journey to everlasting life by a constant reminder of it. And the whole of Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection to come in eternity, for that “one” and first day, multiplied by seven seven times, fills up the seven weeks of sacred Pentecost. It begins on the first day and ends on the same day, revolving fifty times through similar days in between. Eternity is like a circular movement, beginning from the same points where it ends. The ordinances of the Church well taught us to prefer to stand at prayer on this day, as if we were leading our minds from the present to the future. With each going down on the knee and rising up we indicate in deed that we have fallen through sin to the earth and are called up to heaven by the love of our creator.\nSt. Basil the Great, On the Holy Spirit, ed. John Behr, trans. Stephen Hildebrand, vol. 42, Popular Patristics Series (Yonkers, NY: St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 2011), 106 (27.66).\nSymmetry There is symmetry between the days as to the various created domains and what was created to inhabit and order each domain. During days 1–3, God made the forms (or \u0026ldquo;domains\u0026rdquo;) of the cosmos (and in days 4–6 He filled the void within each domain). Day Domain Created Domain's Inhabitants / Creatures Day 1 Light / darkness Lights / stars (including the sun (greater light) and moon (lesser light)) 4 2 Heaven / waters (divided by firmament) Birds / fish 5 3 Land (Earth) (divided from waters (Seas)) / plants Land animals and humans 6 Day 7: Sabbath (rest: God blessed and sanctified) Functional vs. materialist ontology Quote To modern people, the opposite of the created order is “nothing,” that is, a vacuum. To the ancients, the opposite of the created order was something much worse than “nothing.” It was an active, malevolent force we can best term “chaos.” In this verse, chaos is envisioned as a dark, undifferentiated mass of water.\nAdele Berlin, Marc Zvi Brettler, and Michael Fishbane, eds., The Jewish Study Bible (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 13.\nThe Genesis account assumes the Mesopotamian worldview that consisted of primordial chaos prior to the functional ontological formation of the cosmic order. This was envisioned as chaotic waters and explains why the Spirit hovered upon the surface (literally \u0026ldquo;face\u0026rdquo; in the Hebrew) of such waters (עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם) in the creation narrative. Quote In Egyptian views of origins there is the concept of the \u0026ldquo;nonexistent\u0026rdquo; that may be very close to what is expressed here in Genesis. It is viewed as that which has not yet been differentiated and assigned function. No boundaries or definitions have been established. The Egyptian concept, however, also carries with it the idea of potentiality and a quality of being absolute.\nVictor Harold Matthews, Mark W. Chavalas, and John H. Walton, The IVP Bible Background Commentary: Old Testament, electronic ed. (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2000), Genesis 1:2.\nJohn Walton refers to this as a \u0026ldquo;functional ontology.\u0026rdquo; As opposed to a \u0026ldquo;materialist ontology\u0026rdquo; which views nonexistence as the absence of matter, a functional ontology sees nonexistence as a state of chaos that lacks order (often represented in ancient cultures as primordial waters). Leitwort The Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; (טֹ֑וב / tov) shows up frequently in the creation narrative. In the Hebrew MT: Quote The role of the number seven in 1:1–2:3 extends, in fact, beyond the obvious division of the acts of creation into a seven-day sequence. For example, the expression, And God saw that [something He made] was good or very good occurs seven times, but not on every day of the primordial week. Missing on the second and seventh, it appears twice on the adjacent third and sixth days (1:10, 12, 25, 31). Similarly, the word “God” occurs exactly thirty-five times (i.e., five times seven) in our passage, and the section devoted to the seventh day (2:1–3) has exactly thirty-five words in the Heb.\nAdele Berlin, Marc Zvi Brettler, and Michael Fishbane, eds., The Jewish Study Bible (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 12.\nWhile \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; (טֹ֑וב / tov) occurs seven times in the Hebrew MT, the distribution differs in the LXX and \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; (καλός / kalos) occurs eight times based on my count using the Göttingen LXX. I compared this to BHQ. I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked the counts of the other words from this quote. Days 4–5 (1:14–23) Lectionary 1st Tuesday of Great Lent Translation Genesis 1:14–23 (ENGLXXUP), altered 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, to divide between day and night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. 15 And let them be for light in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth, and it was so. 16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light for regulating the day and the lesser light for regulating the night, the stars also. 17 And God placed them in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth, 18 and to regulate day and night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.\n20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth reptiles having life, and winged creatures flying above the earth in the firmament of heaven, and it was so. 21 And God made [the] great [sea monstersa], and every living reptile, which the waters brought forth according to their kinds, and every creature that flies with wings according to its kind, and God saw that they were good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the creatures that fly be multiplied on the earth. 23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.\na Brenton / ENGLXXUP translated τὰ κήτη (ta kētē) as \u0026ldquo;whales.\u0026rdquo;\nNotes There is symmetry between the days as to the various created domains and what was created to inhabit and order each domain. Days 4–5 fill the domains created on days 1–2. See Symmetry. Quote 5: Since the sun is not created until the fourth day (1:14–19), the light of the first three days is of a different order from what we know. A midrash teaches that when God saw the corruption of the generations of the flood and of the tower of Babel, He hid that primordial light away for the benefit of the righteous in the world-to-come (b. Ḥagigah 12a). Other ancient Near Eastern myths similarly assume the existence of light before the creation of the luminaries\u0026hellip;.\n16: The sun and moon are created only on the fourth day and are not named, but referred to only as the greater light and the lesser light. This may be an implicit polemic against the worship of astral bodies (see 2 Kings 23:5).\nAdele Berlin, Marc Zvi Brettler, and Michael Fishbane, eds., The Jewish Study Bible (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 13–14.\nVarious commentators have indicated that the creation account parallels the assembly of the tabernacle in Exodus. For example, in the Hebrew MT, מְאֹרֹת֙ (meorōt) is used for \u0026ldquo;lights\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;luminaries\u0026rdquo;), which is the same word used to describe the lights in the tabernacle lampstand (e.g., Exodus 25:6; 27:20; 35:14). In the Hebrew MT, מְאֹרֹת֙ (meorōt) appears 5 times in Genesis (all uses in vv. 14–16). Quote The seven lamps on the lampstand may have been associated with the seven light-sources visible to the naked eye (five planets, sun and moon)\u0026hellip;. [Walton] proposed that the cosmos itself was conceived of as a huge temple.\nG. K. Beale, The Temple and the Church’s Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God, New Studies in Biblical Theology 17 (Downers Grove, Ill: Apollos : Inter-Varsity Press, 2004), 34.\nv. 21: The Hebrew MT has the the word תַּנִּין (tannin) which is frequently translated as “sea monster” (but also can also carry the sense of “snake” or “serpent” and is sometimes also translated \u0026ldquo;dragon\u0026rdquo;). The LXX translated this as κῆτος (kētos), the corresponding Greek word for “sea monster” (“such as tried to swallow Andromeda” in Greek mythology; see BDAG 2000, 544). In contrast to the clear early Greek understanding of this Hebrew word, the KJV and Brenton both translated it into English as \u0026ldquo;great whales,\u0026rdquo; which was perhaps a deliberate choice to avoid implications of mythology (even the Latin Vulgate here has cētus, a cognate of the Greek lemma).\nIn other ancient myths, creation results from the slaying of a sea monster, and this imagery shows up throughout the Old Testament. Such references, including other mentions of sea monster(s) in the LXX, include 3 Maccabees 6:8; Psalm 73(74):12–17; Job 3:8; 9:13; 26:5–13; Sirach 43:25; Jonah 2:1–2, 11; Isaiah 27:1; 51:9–10; Daniel 3:79).\nI think the Hebrew here contains an intentional affront to Ugaritic (i.e., Canaanite) mythology. In Ugaritic accounts, Baal battles against Yamm (which is a homonym of the Hebrew word for “sea”, yam), the sea monster who is also referred to as Tannun and Litanu. In an Ugaritic account, Baal defeated Yamm as well as the sea itself (yam). The overlap here with biblical terminology is apparent.\nCf. James Bennett Pritchard, ed., The Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, 3rd ed. with Supplement. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969), 129–131. The affront to Ugaritic mythology is even clearer in Psalm 74 (Hebrew MT), which connects the crossing of the sea in the exodus event to creation, alluding to common ANE creation mythology (just as God defeated the chaotic waters in creation, he again subdued chaos and his people crossed the sea on dry land). The Psalmist connects the parting of the sea to God’s creation of the cosmos, showing how intertwined such ideas were in ANE thought:\nPsalm 74:12–17 (translation from the Hebrew) 12 But God has been my king from long ago,\nworking salvation in the middle of the earth.\n13 You parted the sea [יָ֑ם / yam] by your strength;\nYou broke the heads of the sea monsters [תַ֝נִּינִ֗ים / tanninim] in the waters.\n14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan [לִוְיָתָ֑ן]; you gave him as food to the desert-dwelling animals.\n15 You split open spring and wadi.\nYou dried up ever-flowing rivers.\n16 Yours is the day, yours is the night also. You established light and the sun.\n17 You defined all the boundaries of the earth;\nSummer and winter—you formed them. Days 6–7 (1:24–2:3) Lectionary 1st Wednesday of Great Lent Translation Genesis 1:24–2:3 (ENGLXXUP) 24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind, quadrupeds and reptiles and wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and it was so. 25 And God made the wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and cattle according to their kind, and all the reptiles of the earth according to their kind, and God saw that they were good.\n26 And God said, Let us make man according to our image and likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the flying creatures of heaven, and over the cattle and all the earth, and over all the reptiles that creep on the earth. 27 And God made man, according to the image of God he made him, male and female he made them. 28 And God blessed them, saying, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the seas and flying creatures of heaven, and all the cattle and all the earth, and all the reptiles that creep on the earth. 29 And God said, Behold I have given to you every seed-bearing herb sowing seed which is upon all the earth, and every tree which has in itself the fruit of seed that is sown, to you it shall be for food. 30 And to all the wild beasts of the earth, and to all the flying creatures of heaven, and to every reptile creeping on the earth, which has in itself the breath of life, even every green plant for food; and it was so. 31 And God saw all the things that he had made, and, behold, they were very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n2 1 And the heavens and the earth were finished, and the whole world of them.\n2 And God finished on the sixth day his works which he made, and he ceased on the seventh day from all his works which he made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he ceased from all his works which God began to do.\nNotes There is symmetry between the days as to the various created domains and what was created to inhabit and order each domain. Day 6 fills the domain created on day 3. See Symmetry. God\u0026rsquo;s image and likeness 26: God created humans according to the divine image (εἰκών / icon) and likeness (ὁμοίωσις / homoiōsis). The fathers at times maintain a distinction between Jesus, who \u0026ldquo;is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation\u0026rdquo; (Colossians 1:15, BTV, emphasis added), and humans, who are created according to God\u0026rsquo;s image.\nA number of fathers also discuss how human beings were created according to the divine image but lost the likeness. For example, Gregory of Nyssa essentially taught that we possess the image by creation but acquire the likeness through exercising our free will (On the Making of Man 11.3). Quote And then, again, this Word was manifested when the Word of God was made man, assimilating Himself to man, and man to Himself, so that by means of his resemblance to the Son, man might become precious to the Father. For in times long past, it was said that man was created after the image of God, but it was not [actually] shown for the Word was as yet invisible, after whose image man was created. Wherefore also he did easily lose the similitude. When, however, the Word of God became flesh, He confirmed both these: for He both showed forth the image truly, since He became Himself what was His image; and He re-established the similitude after a sure manner, by assimilating man to the invisible Father through means of the visible Word.\nIrenaeus of Lyons, “Irenæus against Heresies,” in The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. Cleveland Coxe, vol. 1, The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Company, 1885), 544 (Adv. Haer. 5.16.2).\nThe divine image in the ANE context brought with it an understanding of shared essence when applied to idols. Quote In the ancient world an image was believed to carry the essence of that which it represented. An idol image of deity, the same terminology as used here, would be used in the worship of that deity because it contained the deity’s essence. This would not suggest that the image could do what the deity could do, nor that it looked the same as the deity. Rather, the deity’s work was thought to be accomplished through the idol. In similar ways the governing work of God was seen to be accomplished by people. But that is not all there is to the image of God. Genesis 5:1–3 likens the image of God in Adam to the image of Adam in Seth. This goes beyond the comment about plants and animals reproducing after their own kind, though certainly children share physical characteristics and basic nature (genetically) with their parents. What draws the idol imagery and the child imagery together is the concept that the image provides the capacity not only to serve in the place of God (his representative containing his essence) but also to be and act like him. The tools he provided so that we may accomplish that task include conscience, self-awareness and spiritual discernment. Mesopotamian traditions speak of sons being in the image of their fathers (Enuma Elish) but do not speak of humans created in the image of God; but the Egyptian Instructions of Merikare identifies humankind as the god’s images who came from his body. In Mesopotamia a significance of the image can be seen in the practice of kings setting up images of themselves in places where they want to establish their authority. Other than that, it is only other gods who are made in the image of gods.\nVictor Harold Matthews, Mark W. Chavalas, and John H. Walton, The IVP Bible Background Commentary: Old Testament, electronic ed. (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2000), Ge 1:26–27.\nBearing God\u0026rsquo;s image carried the idea of ruling authority in the ANE and was reserved for kings traditionally. Hence it is radical for the Bible to indicate that all human beings were created according to the divine image. Quote In the Ancient Near East, only the king was held to be the \u0026ldquo;image and likeness\u0026rdquo; of God on earth; therefore, only the king could be the latter\u0026rsquo;s sole representative with authority over other men\u0026hellip;.\nThus, in a masterly way the author planted at the heart of the creation story the central characteristic of the biblical view: that God himself is the king, the sole king, the king who rules the world without any mediation. Nevertheless, God preserves the right to choose any man (as he did the prophets) to speak on his behalf at any time\u0026hellip;.\nThe polemical aspect of this teaching can be better appreciated when one recalls that Ancient Near Eastern mythologies depicted the history of mankind as a lineage of kings who ruled from the beginning of creation. Moreover, creation itself was generally conceived as the orderly realm of the king\u0026rsquo;s city\u0026hellip;. The biblical writer, on the other hand, replaced the royal genealogies of extra-biblical histories with the genealogies of mere men.\nPaul Nadim Tarazi, The Old Testament: An Introduction. Vol 1: Historical Traditions, vol. 1, 3 vols. (Crestwood, N.Y: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1991), 83–84.\nSabbath On the sixth day, God indicated that his work was finished and He instituted and rested on the Sabbath. Likewise, Jesus indicated that \u0026ldquo;It is finished\u0026rdquo; on the cross, and then proceeded to rest on the Sabbath (creation \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; new creation). In both instances, this is not to take a break because God is tired, but rather, God is taking His seat as King and Lord. Quote Man failed to keep this Sabbath-rest. But Jesus fulfilled it for man by resting in the tomb on Great and Holy Saturday, after He said on the cross, “It is finished” (Jn 19:30). For He destroyed sin and death, and rose again on the first day of the week. Through His saving work on man’s behalf, He is man’s Sabbath-rest, and He now invites all to find rest in Himself (Mt 11:28–30).\nOSB 2008, 5.\nCreation of Adam (2:4–19) Lectionary 1st Thursday of Great Lent Translation Genesis 2:4–19 (ENGLXXUP), altered 4 This is the book of the generation of heaven and earth, when they were made, in the day in which the Lord God made the heaven and the earth, 5 and every herb of the field before it was on the earth, and all the grass of the field before it sprang up, for God had not rained on the earth, and there was not a man to cultivate it. 6 But there rose a fountain out of the earth, and watered the whole face of the earth. 7 And God formed the man of dust of the earth, and breathed upon his face the breath of life, and the man became a living soul.\n8 And God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and placed there the man whom he had formed. 9 And God made to spring up also out of the earth every tree beautiful to the eye and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of learning the knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river proceeds out of Eden to water the garden, thence it divides itself into four heads. 11 The name of the one, Pishon, this it is which encircles the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 And the gold of that land is good, there also is carbuncle and emerald. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon, this it is which encircles the whole land of Ethiopia. 14 And the third river is Tigris, this is that which flows forth over against the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 15 And the Lord God took the man whom he had formed, and placed him in the gardena, to cultivate and keep it. 16 And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, Of every tree which is in the garden thou mayest freely eat, 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—of it ye shall not eat, but in whatsoever day ye eat of it, ye shall surely die.\n18 And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, let us make for him a help suitable to him. 19 And God formed yet farther out of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the birds of the sky, and he brought them to Adam, to see what he would call them, and whatever Adam called any living creature, that was the name of it.\na Brenton / ENGLXXUP translated παραδείσῳ (paradeisō) as \u0026ldquo;garden of Delight.\u0026rdquo;\nNotes Numerous commentators, ancient and contemporary, have observed that this pericope contains a second creation account. Source-critical scholarship attributes each creation account to a different source (the first to P and this one J). A number of features about this creation account subverted the expectations of readers in the ANE.\n4: This verse contains the title of the book, Genesis (γενέσεως), translated as \u0026ldquo;generation\u0026rdquo; by Brenton (as reflected in the ENGLXXUP). In the Hebrew, this verse contains the first instance of the toledot formula.\n6: The Hebrew word for \u0026ldquo;fountain\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stream\u0026rdquo; is challenging to translate (Hebrew: אֵד / ēd; translated into Greek as πηγή / pēgē). It may refer to \u0026ldquo;the subterranean stream of fresh water, groundwater\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the celestial stream\u0026rdquo; (HALOT 2000, 11). A similar word appears in early Sumerian and Babylonian mythological accounts in reference to an underground primordial river.\n7: The Hebrew contains an etymological pun on \u0026ldquo;man\u0026rdquo; (אָדָם / adam) and \u0026ldquo;ground\u0026rdquo; (אֲדָמָה / adamah). Robert Alter\u0026rsquo;s translation which seeks to maintain this wordplay in English is clever: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; then the LORD God fashioned the human, humus from the soil\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Alter 2019).\nThe fathers indicate that God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit / breath gave man his spirit/breath/animation, differentiating the spirit from the body, the latter of which came from matter. However, the result represents the union of the divine and corporeal into \u0026ldquo;a living soul.\u0026rdquo; The animals were not animated by God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit / breath, so this distinguishes humans from other creatures. 8: While \u0026ldquo;east\u0026rdquo; could be a reference to direction, מִקֶּ֑דֶם (miqqedem) could also be a temporal (rather than geospatial) reference and thus translated \u0026ldquo;in ancient / prehistoric times,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;in days of old,\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;in the beginning\u0026rdquo; (e.g., Psalm 76(77):6, 12; 142(143):5; Proverbs 8:22–23). The LXX assumes it is geospatial (κατὰ ἀνατολάς / kata anatolas), but other early translations assumed it was temporal, including other Greek translations (e.g., Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion), Aramaic translations (targums), the Syriac, and the Latin Vulgate (a principio). Cf. HALOT 2000, 1069–1070 (קֶדֶם). The ambiguity may be intentional.\nQuote What is striking, however, is that this yahweh forms a regular human being—not a king—and installs him in a garden—not a city.

This man did not wear clothes or live in a house but among the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, \u0026ldquo;What do yoʋ have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg yoʋ, do not torment me.\u0026rdquo; 29 For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and he would be bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, but he would break the chains and be driven by the demon into desolate places. 30 Jesus then asked him, \u0026ldquo;What is yoʋr name?\u0026rdquo; He said, \u0026ldquo;Legion,\u0026rdquo; for many demons had entered him. 31 And dhe begged Jesus not to command them to go away into the abyss.\n32 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding there on the mountain. The demons begged Jesus to permit them to enter the pigs. So he gave them permission. 33 Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.\n34 When those who had been feeding the pigs saw what happened, they ran eoff and reported it in the city and in the countryside. 35 So the people came out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus\u0026rsquo; feet, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 36 Those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been delivered. 37 Then the entire multitude from the surrounding region of the fGadarenes asked Jesus to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into gthe boat and left. 38 Now the man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him.

See note on v. 26.\n41: The name Jairus is a possible allusion to Jair (Judges 10:3–5). Interestingly, Jair was a Gileadite (the land Jesus just returned from), and the next judge, Jephthah, has some interesting parallels/reversals to this account.\nMichael Heiser noted similarities between Jephthah\u0026rsquo;s tragedy and Jesus\u0026rsquo; raising of Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter in this pericope. Notable examples include:\nName similarity: Jair vs. Jairus.\nGilead connection: Jair (and Jepthah) was a Gileadite, Jesus just returned from Gilead.\nOnly daughter: Both Jephthah\u0026rsquo;s and Jairus\u0026rsquo; only daughter is the one who dies.\nReversal of outcome: Whereas Jephthah\u0026rsquo;s daughter dies due to his own foolishness, Jesus raises Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter from the dead.\nMichael Heiser, I dare you not to bore me with the Bible (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2014), locs. 637–681 (Kindle edition). 43–48: The healing of the \u0026ldquo;woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years\u0026rdquo; is interjected in the middle of the account of Jesus healing Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter.\n42–43: The woman in the crowd has been bleeding for the entire lifespan of Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter: 12 years. The number itself of course has additional symbolism, and everyone in these accounts has been waiting for Jesus (see also v. 40).\nBoth accounts (and the preceding encounter with the Gadarene demoniac) involve Jesus coming into contact with things that cause ritual impurity (menstruating woman, death).\n43: She \u0026ldquo;had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any.\u0026rdquo;\nQuote Her misery is thus threefold: she has no more possessions, she has lost her health, and her ritual impurity has separated her from God and from other people. In this condition she nevertheless dares to hope and to trust in Jesus. The stereotypical formula, \u0026ldquo;your faith has saved you,\u0026rdquo; has a sociological functional setting in the early Christian church: the woman with the discharge of blood is the symbol of people who would like to be accepted by the church. With this formula, and with the telling of such miracle stories, the early church, in contrast to the synagogue, emphasizes its conviction that God will not keep such people at a distance. Unlike God\u0026rsquo;s law regarding the sanctuary (Lev 15:31), Jesus as the representative of God does not subject such people with discharges of blood to the danger of death. On the contrary, a healing power streams forth from him that restores life (v. 46). The instant healing (παραχρῆμα, \u0026ldquo;immediately,\u0026rdquo; v. 44, is repeated in the conclusion in v. 47) shows divine agreement and the new definition of faith.\nFrançois Bovon and Helmut Koester, Luke 1: A Commentary on the Gospel of Luke 1:1–9:50, Hermeneia—A Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2002), 338.\n44: She \u0026ldquo;touched the fringe of his cloak.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Fringe\u0026rdquo; here is κράσπεδον, which may refer to the \u0026ldquo;tassel (צִיצִת) which an Israelite was obligated to wear on the four corners of his outer garment\u0026rdquo; (BDAG 2000, 564; see also Numbers 15:37–39).\n48: Jesus refers to the woman as \u0026ldquo;daughter\u0026rdquo; despite likely being younger than her, further emphasizing the daughter motif in this pericope.\n","description":"Master over storms (8:22–25) Translation Notes Encounter with the Gadarenes demoniac (8:26–39) Translation Notes Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter raised from the dead and woman with bleeding issue healed (8:40–56) Translation Notes This pericope begins a section of multiple accounts demonstrating Jesus\u0026rsquo; power over nature / primordial chaos (wind and waves; vv. 22–25), unclean spirits (vv. 26–39), disease, and death (vv. 40–56).\nMaster over storms (8:22–25) Lectionary 21st Wednesday after Pentecost Translation Luke 8:22–25 (TCENT) 22 One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, \u0026ldquo;Let us cross over to the other side of the lake."},{"id":5,"href":"/privacy/","title":"Privacy Policy","parent":"Byzantique","content":"Last updated: March 29, 2023\nThis website, its hosting provider(s), and/or related sites (e.g., sites hosting resources used on this site; collectively \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo;) may collect certain Usage Data that could potentially be used to contact or identify you.

This site contains my notes on Scriptural (and perhaps other) ancient texts from the Byzantine Christian tradition. Eastern Christianity has some distinctives and so it is fitting to indicate as such.

I alone am responsible for the content here and it is not endorsed by anyone.\nWho are you? I\u0026rsquo;ve answered that question on the Welcome page.\nHow do I contact you? See the Contact page.\nWhat inspired you to make this website? Inspiration for this site includes:\nBuls\u0026rsquo; Notes Search the Scriptures Lord of Spirits podcast The Whole Counsel of God blog BibleProject I have been using Evernote and documents saved on my computer for a long time to keep track of various notes, but it\u0026rsquo;s getting harder to find things, so I figured a more organized approach is in order. Also, posting it publicly allows me to more easily share my notes with others when referencing them in discussions. Hence this site.\nWith that said, I update this in my free time, which is limited. A lot of my notes haven\u0026rsquo;t been migrated here yet, and the process is a bit burdensome.\nWhy do you use archaic language in the Old Testament? Unfortunately, many English translations of the Bible are copyrighted in such a way that does not allow me to use large portions of these translations on this website. That is unfortunate. As such, I\u0026rsquo;ve opted to predominantly quote the Scriptures from public domain texts or from works licensed in ways that don\u0026rsquo;t heavily restrict my ability to cite them (e.g., Creative Commons licenses, copyright licenses explicitly allowing usage for nonprofit purposes, etc.).\nFor the New Testament, there are some great translations in contemporary English that are public domain or that otherwise can be cited from relatively freely (e.g., BTV, TCENT, WEB, NET). For the Old Testament translated from the Hebrew MT, there are similarly good translations in contemporary English with permissive licensing (e.g., WEB, JPS Tanakh 1917). However, for the Greek LXX Old Testament, the options are more limited. I herein predominantly quote the LXX from the ENGLXXUP, which is a modernized version of Brenton\u0026rsquo;s 1851 Septuagint English translation (Robert Adam Boyd revised it in 2020 and released it into the public domain).\nWhat does this abbreviation mean? See the list of Common Abbreviations used on this site.\nWhy is there a weird letter \u0026lsquo;u\u0026rsquo; in quotes from the Bible? The BTV and TCENT translation use the \u0026lsquo;ʋ\u0026rsquo; character to indicate second person singular pronouns.\nQuote One of the greatest advantages of archaic translations like the King James Version is the ability to differentiate between second person singular and second person plural by the use of archaic pronouns such as thou and ye. In order to maintain these distinctions, the Byzantine Text Version differentiates between second person singular and second person plural by using an alternate letter (ʋ) in second person singular pronouns. Consequently, the words yoʋ, yoʋr, and yoʋrs indicate second person singular, while the words you, your, and yours indicate second person plural. The casual reader will barely notice the difference, while the careful reader will be able to discern whether the pronoun is singular or plural.\n\u0026ldquo;Matters of Orthography,\u0026rdquo; in Introduction to Robert Adam Boyd, Byzantine Text Version (BTV) 2021.

The Septuagint is an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. The word septugaginta is Latin for the number 70, and so it is commonly abbreviated with the equivalent Roman numerals (LXX). This is the Bible that the apostles and most early Christians read, and is the main Bible that the New Testament authors quoted from. The Septuagint contains additional books (and different content in several books) than the later Hebrew canon used by many Protestant Christians today. The Eastern Orthodox Church (and other Byzantine Christian churches) considers the LXX to be canonical Scripture, along with its longer canon (called the \u0026ldquo;Apocrypha\u0026rdquo; by Protestant Christians, and a subset of which is called the \u0026ldquo;Deuterocanon\u0026rdquo; by Roman Catholics).

Quote If you think about it, the mind has two \u0026ldquo;gears,\u0026rdquo; forward and reverse. Forward gear is when you are thinking something through, following a line of thought, reasoning in a logical way—the dianoia\u0026hellip;. In English today, when we speak of \u0026ldquo;the mind\u0026rdquo; we mean those active ways of thinking (usually setting them opposite to \u0026ldquo;the heart\u0026rdquo; or emotions).\nBut the mind also has a \u0026ldquo;reverse gear\u0026rdquo;: it can receive information. This is our ability to understand, comprehend, discern, or perceive. In biblical Greek it is called the nous \u0026hellip; ([and as is other times the case,] the word doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean in Scripture what it does in Aristotle and Plato)\u0026hellip;.\nBroadly speaking, [the nous] is our capacity to encounter life firsthand, our receptive awareness\u0026hellip;. If God were to interact with us, it would be by means of the nous, not through our emotions or our reasoning ability\u0026hellip;. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how the word nous is used in Scripture. When Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, he \u0026ldquo;opened their nous to understand the Scriptures\u0026rdquo; ([Luke] 24:45). Since English translations say that he opened their \u0026ldquo;mind,\u0026rdquo; you might have thought that he made them intellectually sharper, better equipped to defend the Scriptures. No, he enabled the disciples to perceive something; he enabled them to see the prophecies of his life and work woven through the Old Testament like a silver thread. It had been there all along, but they had been unable to see it.
