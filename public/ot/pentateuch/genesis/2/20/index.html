However, the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (<em>nachash</em>) could potentially also have been understood in other ways (not to imply that it should be translated differently, but that an ancient reader might have had these connections in mind within their &ldquo;cognitive framework&rdquo;). The implication is that an ancient reader would have known the &ldquo;serpent&rdquo; was a divine being that gave an omen to Eve—the account would <em>not</em> have been (mis)understood as a fairy tale about a talking snake. Additional semantic domains of the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (<em>nachash</em>) in addition to its primary sense as &ldquo;serpent&rdquo; include:</p><ul><li><p>The <em>verbal</em> root (<em>binyan</em>) נחשׁ (<em>n-ch-sh</em>) of the noun means &ldquo;to seek and tell omens, foretell&rdquo; and so refers to divination (HALOT 2000, 690).</p></li><li><p>Luminescent / brazen, as it pertains to copper / bronze (related by the <em>binyan</em> (נחשׁ) of נְחֹשֶׁת / <em>nechoshet</em>). See also the reference to the city of <em>Nachash</em> in 1 Chronicles 4:12, which implies a city of copper / bronze smiths. Copper / bronze is used in descriptions of divine beings as well (cf. Daniel 10:6 in the MT). The emphasis on &ldquo;shining&rdquo; or &ldquo;luminescence&rdquo; may be a bit of a stretch in my opinion, but the connection to copper / bronze is clear both in Hebrew and Aramaic.</p><ul><li>Cf.

Heiser, <em>The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible</em> (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2015), 87–88, 90, and at 88:fn2.</li></ul></li><li><p>&ldquo;Snakes were a symbol in the ancient world of wisdom, fertility, and immortality.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><em>New Oxford Annotated Bible</em>, Fully Revised Fifth Edition, ed.

In v. 6, we learn that Adam was &ldquo;with her.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><strong>2–3:</strong> Both St. Ephrem the Syrian and St. John of Damascus taught that Adam and Eve had a pre-existing relationship with the serpent (cf. St. Ephrem the Syrian, <em>Hymns on Paradise</em> 3.4; St. John the Damascene, <em>An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith</em> 2.10). St. Ephrem the Syrian also taught that the animals could not enter paradise, so Adam and Eve had to go outside the garden to meet with the serpent. In the previously referenced hymn, he expresses that the serpent only learned of God&rsquo;s prohibition to Adam and Eve concerning the tree of knowledge through prior conversation. Whereas some contemporary commentators believe that Eve exaggerated God&rsquo;s prohibition by saying they were not even to touch the tree, several of the fathers went further to indicate that Adam and Eve were not even supposed to look at the tree lest they be enticed by its beauty (cf., e.g., St. Ephrem the Syrian, <em>Commentary on Genesis</em> <a class=gdoc-markdown__link href=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/anderson/commentaries/EphGen.html#glossGen3:2,Gen3:3>2.20.1</a>). St. Ephrem indicated that the tree of knowledge served &ldquo;as a boundary to the inner region of Paradise&mldr;. [and] that it was not lawful to penetrate further, beyond that Tree.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>St. Ephrem, <em>Hymns on Paradise</em>, trans. Sebastian Brock, <em>Popular Patristics Series</em> (Crestwood, NY: St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1990), 91 (3.3).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>3:</strong> St. Ambrose indicated that God only spoke directly to Adam, whereas Eve learned of the prohibition concerning the tree from her husband. Thus, the serpent&rsquo;s temptation of Eve was a means of circumventing Adam (<em>On Paradise</em> <a class=gdoc-markdown__link href=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/anderson/commentaries/Amb.html#glossGen3:1>12 (333)</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>5:</strong> The LXX indicates that if Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, they will be &ldquo;<em>as gods</em>&rdquo; (ὡς θεοί / <em>hos theoi</em>), which corresponds to the Hebrew הְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽאלֹהִ֔ים (<em>heyitem k&rsquo;elohim</em>; i.e. &ldquo;like the gods&rdquo;). However, the gramatically plural <em>elohim</em> is generally translated in the singular, so English translations of the Hebrew often render this &ldquo;like God.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><strong>6:</strong> Note that Adam was &ldquo;with her,&rdquo; yet did not protest, and he also <em>chose</em> to eat the forbidden fruit. Eve chose to listen to the serpent&rsquo;s (re)interpretation of God&rsquo;s word. &ldquo;Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: For if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee&rdquo; (Wisdom of Sirach [Ecclesiasticus] 21:2a, ENGLXXUP). By listening to the serpent instead of to God, &ldquo;they exchanged the truth of God for falsehood and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator&rdquo; (Romans 1:25, BTV).</p></li></ul><blockquote class="gdoc-hint note"><div class="gdoc-hint__title flex align-center"><svg class="gdoc-icon gdoc_keyboard_arrow_right"><use xlink:href="#gdoc_keyboard_arrow_right"/></svg><span>Quote</span></div><div class=gdoc-hint__text><p>In this account, Eve is faced with two interpretations of reality&mldr;.

If we ascribe this to the nature of the tree, then the fruit of this tree seems to be superior to the vivifying power of the breath of God, since its fruit had drawn into death&rsquo;s toils him on whom the divine breath had bestowed life. If we maintain that God is the responsible cause of death, then we can be held to accuse Him of inconsistency. We seem to accuse Him of being so devoid of beneficence as to be unwilling to pardon when He had the power to do so, or of being powerless if He was unable to forgive. Let us see, therefore, how this question can be resolved. The solution, unless I am mistaken, lies in the fact that, since disobedience was the cause of death, for that very reason, not God, but man himself, was the agent of his own death. If, for example, a physician were to prescribe to a patient what he thought should be avoided, and if the patient felt that these prohibitions were unnecessary, the physician is not responsible for the patient&rsquo;s death. Surely in that case the patient is guilty of causing his own death.
