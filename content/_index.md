Dan's notes on Scripture and other Christian texts.

I made this site primarily for *myself* so that I can access and share my notes from anywhere. For anyone stumbling upon this site who wasn't sent here by me, I hope you find it helpful!

### What does the site name mean?

The site name is wordplay on "Byzantine," "antique," and "boutique." This site contains my notes on Scriptural (and perhaps other) ancient texts and approaches them from within the Byzantine (i.e., Eastern) Christian tradition.

### Work in progress

This site is a work in progress and I add notes as I have time. It is not intended to be comprehensive nor to serve as an introduction to the Scriptures.
