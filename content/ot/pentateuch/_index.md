The Pentateuch is the first five books of the Old Testament, also known as the "Torah" in the Hebrew Bible / Tanakh (*penta* is the Greek word for "five," so *Pentateuch* means something akin to "five scrolls"). These books focus on the creation and ordering of the cosmos, Adam and Eve's expulsion from the garden of Eden, the early history of God's people leading up to Abraham, and the life and history of God's people under the leadership of Moses.
