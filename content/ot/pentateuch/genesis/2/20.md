1st Friday of Great Lent

This entire pericope (2:20–3:20) is read during Vespers on the first Friday of Great Lent, but it has been subdivided on this page for the purpose of providing more organized commentary.

## Creation of Eve (Zoe / Life) (2:20–24)

### Translation

{{<hint type=important icon=gdoc_fire title="Genesis 2:20–25 (ENGLXXUP), altered">}}
<sup><b>20</b></sup> And Adam gave names to all the cattle and to all the birds of the sky, and to all the wild beasts of the field, but for Adam there was not found a help like to himself. <sup><b>21</b></sup> And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh instead thereof. <sup><b>22</b></sup> And God formed the rib which he took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam. <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Adam said, 

This now is bone of my bones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flesh of my flesh;<br />
she shall be called woman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because she was taken out of her [man<sup>a</sup>].<sup>b</sup>

<sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. <sup><b>25</b></sup> And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.

<sup>a</sup> Brenton / ENGLXXUP translated ἀνδρὸς (*andros*) as "husband."

<sup>b</sup> I've here changed the layout to reflect that Adam's song is poetic.

### Notes

- **20:** Augustine and other fathers believed the primary way in which Eve was a help to Adam was her ability to bear children (cf. *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis* 9.5.9). However, others believed that Adam and Eve lived in virginity prior to the Fall so look to other attributes in which she was his help.

- **21–22:** Just as Eve had no earthly mother, Jesus had no earthly father.

{{<hint type=note icon=gdoc_keyboard_arrow_right title="Quote">}}
"Of whom was Eve begotten in the beginning? What mother conceived her who had no mother?" But Scripture says she was born from Adam’s side. Now then, if Eve was born, without a mother, from the side of a man, may not a child be born, without a man, from the womb of a virgin? A debt of gratitude was due from womankind; for Eve was begotten of Adam, not conceived of a mother, but, as it were, brought forth from man alone. Mary, then, paid the debt of gratitude when, not of man, but immaculately of her own self, she conceived of the Holy Spirit by the power of God.

- **23:** The Hebrew contains an etymological pun with "man" (אִישׁ / *ish*) and "woman" (אִשָּׁה / *ishah*), which is generally also present in English (man / wo*man*). I altered Brenton's (ENGLXXUP) translation herein to maintain the wordplay. With that said, Brenton's original translation of "husband" is probably a more appropriate translation of ἀνδρὸς (*andros*) in context.

- **23–24:** St. Paul alludes to Adam's song and calls this union as one flesh a "profound mystery," but relates this relationship between husband and wife to that between Christ and His Church, respectively (Ephesians 5:30–32). Also, just as a husband must leave his parents and "cleave" to his wife, Jesus (in a sense) left the Father (becoming human) to find and redeem His Bride, the Church. The fathers frequently comment on marriage as an example of the relationship between Jesus and the Church.

  - The fathers also commented on the process of God removing Adam's rib, and some fathers believe God caused him to dream for the first time during this process, whereas others focus on the wound on Jesus' side compared to the "wound" of removing Adam's rib. 
  
  - [Robert Alter commented](https://qohelet.io/man-seeks-to-become-one-flesh-with-woman-to-regain-a-lost-part-of-himself) on man's pursuit of woman "to regain a lost part of himself."

- **25:** The fathers indicate that Adam and Eve were clothed in glory prior to the Fall, but then this glory was stripped away from them and they wore a garment of sin. This brought about shame and hence awareness of their nakedness. The fathers connected their nakedness to the baptismal practice in the early Church of entering the water naked.

{{<hint type=note icon=gdoc_keyboard_arrow_right title="Quote">}}
After the anointing, then, it remains to go into the bath of sacred waters. After stripping you of your robe, the priest himself leads you down into the flowing waters. But why naked? He reminds you of your former nakedness, when you were in Paradise and you were not ashamed. For Holy Writ says: *Adam and Eve were naked and were not ashamed*, until they took up the garment of sin, a garment heavy with abundant shame.

Do not, then, feel shame here, for the bath is much better than the garden of Paradise. There can be no serpent here, but Christ is here initiating you into the regeneration that comes from the water and the Spirit. You cannot see here beautiful trees and fruits, but you can see spiritual favors. You cannot find here the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, nor law and commandments, but you can find grace and gifts. *For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under the Law but under grace* [(Romans 6:14)].

- **2:25–3:1:** There is wordplay in the Hebrew connecting these two verses. "And the two of them were *naked* (עֲרוּמִּ֔ים / *arummim*, which is the plural form of *arum*).... Now the serpent was *shrewd* (עָר֔וּם / *arum*)...."

{{<hint type=note icon=gdoc_keyboard_arrow_right title="Quote">}}
The pun ties together the creation of Adam and Eve and their temptation, and it points to the futility of disobedience: "The *nude* humans have been duped by the *shrewd* serpent; they want to be shrewed, but in the end they are only nude...."

Although "nude" would make the pun more obvious in English, "naked" is the right word because of its association with vulnerability and shame.

## The serpent and the Fall of humanity (3:1–20)

### Translation

{{<hint type=important icon=gdoc_fire title="Genesis 3:13:20 (ENGLXXUP), altered">}}
**3** <sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the serpent was the most crafty of all the brutes on the earth, which the Lord God made, and the serpent said to the woman, Wherefore has God said, Eat not of every tree of the garden? <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, <sup><b>3</b></sup> but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die. <sup><b>5</b></sup> For God knew that in whatever day ye should eat of it your eyes would be opened, and ye would be as gods, knowing good and evil. <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to contemplate, and having taken of its fruit she ate, and she gave to her husband also with her, and they ate. <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the eyes of both were opened, and they [knew<sup>a</sup>] that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons to go round them. <sup><b>8</b></sup> And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the afternoon; and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden. <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, Adam, where art thou? <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he said to him, I heard thy voice as thou walkedst in the garden, and I feared because I was naked and I hid myself. <sup><b>11</b></sup> And God said to him, Who told thee that thou wast naked, unless thou hast eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it alone not to eat? <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Adam said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me&mdash;she gave me of the tree and I ate. <sup><b>13</b></sup> And the Lord God said to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me and I ate.

<sup><b>14</b></sup> And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and all the brutes of the earth, on thy breast and belly thou shalt go, and thou shalt eat earth all the days of thy life. <sup><b>15</b></sup> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed, he shall watch against thy head, and thou shalt watch against his heel. <sup><b>16</b></sup> And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pains and thy groanings; in pain thou shalt bring forth children, and thy submission shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. <sup><b>17</b></sup> And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it only not to eat—of that thou hast eaten, cursed is the ground in thy labors, in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. <sup><b>18</b></sup> Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. <sup><b>19</b></sup> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread until thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken, for earth thou art and to earth thou shalt return. <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was the mother of all living.

### Notes

- See note on **2:25–3:1** above for more about the wordplay connecting these verses and sections.

Snakes were a symbol in the ancient world of wisdom, fertility, and immortality.

- **1:** The Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (*nachash*) was translated into the Greek LXX as ὄφις (*ophis*), meaning "snake" or "serpent," which appears to be the primary sense of this word *in its noun form*. However, the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (*nachash*) could potentially also have been understood in other ways (not to imply that it should be translated differently, but that an ancient reader might have had these connections in mind within their "cognitive framework"). The implication is that an ancient reader would have known the "serpent" was a divine being that gave an omen to Eve&mdash;the account would not have been (mis)understood as a fairy tale about a talking snake. Additional semantic domains of the Hebrew word נָחָשׁ (*nachash*) in addition to its primary sense as "serpent":

  - The *verbal* root (*binyan*) נחשׁ (*n-ch-sh*) of the noun means "to seek and tell omens, foretell" and so refers to divination (HALOT 2000, 690).

  - Luminescent / brazen, as it pertains to copper / bronze (related by the *binyan* (נחשׁ) of נְחֹשֶׁת / *nechoshet*). See also the reference to the city of *Nachash* in 1 Chronicles 4:12, which implies a city of copper/bronze smiths. Copper / bronze is used in descriptions of divine beings as well (cf. Daniel 10:6 in the MT). The emphasis on "shining" or "luminescence" may be a bit of a stretch in my opinion, but the connection to copper / bronze is clear both in Hebrew and Aramaic.

    - Cf. Michael S. Heiser, *The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible* (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2015), 87–88, 90, and at 88:fn2.

- **5:** The LXX indicates that if Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, they will be "*as gods*" (ὡς θεοί / *hos theoi*), which corresponds to the Hebrew הְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽאלֹהִ֔ים (*heyitem kelohim*; i.e. "like the gods"). However, the gramatically plural *elohim* is generally translated in the singular, so English translations of the Hebrew often render this "like God."

- **7:** The serpent's promise came true: if eaten, they "would be as gods, *knowing* [γινώσκοντες / *ginōskontes*] good and evil" (v. 5), and now that they have eaten, they *knew* [ἔγνωσαν / *egnōsan*] they were naked" (both words are forms of the same Greek verb meaning "to know" (γινώσκω / *ginōskō*). I altered the above translation to make the usage of the same verb in vv. 5 and 7 apparent.


TODO: ADD MORE HERE


- **20:** I herein refer to the traditional name "Eve" (חַוָּה / *Havvah*) despite the LXX (appropriately) using Ζωή (*Zoe,* meaning "Life") in this pericope. She is later called Eve (Εὕαν) beginning in 4:1 (LXX). The Hebrew חַוָּה (*Havvah*) was etymologically related to חָֽי (*hay*, "the living"), which is retained in the Greek LXX: Ζωή (*Zoe* = "Life") is the mother of the ζώντων (*Zoōntōn* = "living").
