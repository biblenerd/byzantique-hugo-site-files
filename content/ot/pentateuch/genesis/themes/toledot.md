The *Toledot* formula refers to the Hebrew word תּוֹלֵדוֹת (*toledot*), which means "descendants," "histories," or "generations" (in reference to successors, usually introducing a geneaological list and related narratives) and various occurrences of it are thought to divide Genesis into 10–12 sections.

The occurrences in Genesis occur at:

1. 2:4 (heavens and the earth); *some don't consider this instance to be a section marker*
2. 5:1 (Adam)
3. 6:9 (Noah)
4. 10:1 (Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, Japheth); *it also occurs at 10:32 but this is thought to be part of this "section"*
5. 11:10 (Shem)
6. 11:27 (Terah, father of Abraham)
7. 25:12–13 (Abraham's son: Ishmael)
8. 25:19 (Abraham's son: Isaac, father of Jacob); *some don't consider this instance to be a section marker*
9. 36:1 (Isaac's son: Esau); *it also occurs at 36:9 and specifically emphasizes Esau as the father of the Edomites, but some consider this to be part of this same section*
10. 37:2 (Isaac's son: Jacob, father of Joseph); *some don't consider this instance to be a section marker*
