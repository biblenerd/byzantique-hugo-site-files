<sup><b>21</b></sup> And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin, and clothed them.

<sup><b>22</b></sup> And God said, Behold, Adam is become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now lest at any time he stretch forth his hand, and take of the tree of life and eat, and so he shall live forever&mdash; <sup><b>23</b></sup> So the Lord God sent him forth out of the garden of Delight to cultivate the ground out of which he was taken. <sup><b>24</b></sup> And he cast out Adam and caused him to dwell [opposite<sup>a</sup>] the garden of Delight, and stationed the cherubs and the fiery sword that turns about to [guard<sup>b</sup>] the way of the tree of life.

## The First Children (4:1–7)

### Translation

{{<hint type=important icon=gdoc_fire title="Genesis 4:1–7 (ENGLXXUP), altered">}}
<sup><b>1</b></sup> And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain and said, I have gained a man through God. <sup><b>2</b></sup> And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. <sup><b>3</b></sup> And it was so after some time that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord. <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Abel also brought of the firstborn of his sheep and of his fatlings, and God looked upon Abel and his gifts, <sup><b>5</b></sup> but Cain and his sacrifices he regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful and his countenance fell. <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the Lord God said to Cain, Why art thou become very sorrowful and why is thy countenance fallen? <sup><b>7</b></sup> Hast thou not sinned if thou hast brought it rightly, but not rightly divided it? Be<sup>a</sup> still, to thee shall be his [recourse<sup>b</sup>], and thou shalt rule over him.
