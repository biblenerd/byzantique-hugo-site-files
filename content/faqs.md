## What does the site name mean?

This site contains my notes on Scriptural (and perhaps other) ancient texts from the Byzantine Christian tradition. Eastern Christianity has some distinctives and so it is fitting to indicate as such. The site name is wordplay on "Byzantine," "antique," and "boutique."

## Is this site affiliated with or endorsed by any specific church, religion, movement, organization, political party, color, musical genre, etc.?

**No.**

Any opinions expressed on this site are my own, except for the ones I've gleaned from much smarter people or subconsciously espouse as a result of my upbringing. In any event, the opinions expressed here are obviously not my employer's.

This site should *not* be construed to represent any official position of the Orthodox Church nor any specific parish. I alone am responsible for the content here and it is not endorsed by anyone.

## Who are you?

I've answered that question [on the Welcome page.](/welcome/#who-are-you)

## How do I contact you?

## What inspired you to make this website?

Inspiration for this site includes:

- [Buls' Notes](http://pericope.org/buls-notes/index.html)
- [Search the Scriptures](https://orthodoxbiblestudy.info)
- [Lord of Spirits podcast](https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/lordofspirits)
- [The Whole Counsel of God blog](https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/wholecounsel/)
- [BibleProject](https://bibleproject.com)

I have been using Evernote and documents saved on my computer for a long time to keep track of various notes, but it's getting harder to find things, so I figured a more organized approach is in order. Also, posting it publicly allows me to more easily share my notes with others when referencing them in discussions. Hence this site.

With that said, I update this in my free time, which is limited. A lot of my notes haven't been migrated here yet, and the process is a bit burdensome.

## Why do you use archaic language in the Old Testament?

Unfortunately, many English translations of the Bible are copyrighted in such a way that does not allow me to use large portions of these translations on this website. That is unfortunate. As such, I've opted to predominantly quote the Scriptures from public domain texts or from works licensed in ways that don't heavily restrict my ability to cite them (e.g., Creative Commons licenses, copyright licenses explicitly allowing usage for nonprofit purposes, etc.). 

For the New Testament, there are some great translations in contemporary English that are public domain or that otherwise can be cited from relatively freely (e.g., BTV, TCENT, WEB, NET). For the Old Testament translated from the Hebrew MT, there are similarly good translations in contemporary English with permissive licensing (e.g., WEB, JPS Tanakh 1917). However, for the Greek LXX Old Testament, the options are more limited. I herein predominantly quote the LXX from the ENGLXXUP, which is a modernized version of Brenton's 1851 Septuagint English translation (Robert Adam Boyd revised it in 2020 and released it into the public domain).
