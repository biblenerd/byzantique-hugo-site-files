Welcome to **Byzantique!**

{{<hint type=important icon=gdoc_fire title="James 1:22-25 (BTV)">}}

But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away, and then immediately forgets what he looks like. But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts. He will be blessed in what he does.

This site contains my notes on Scripture and other Christian texts.

I made this site primarily for *myself* so that I can access and share my notes from anywhere. For anyone stumbling upon this site who wasn't sent here by me, I hope you find it helpful!

This site is a work in progress and I add notes as I have time. **It is not intended to be comprehensive nor to serve as an introduction to the Scriptures.** If you find something helpful, great! However, if you find it confusing, I know that I don't explain most things and I assume a bit of knowledge. I often only allude to ideas without fully developing them. 

I do *not* intend to write an introductory resource&mdash;there are plenty of others who have done that already. At some point, I'll probably post some recommended resources for learning more. In the interim, there are lots of citations throughout this site you can consult.
