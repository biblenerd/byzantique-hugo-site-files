This website, its hosting provider(s), and/or related sites (e.g., sites hosting resources used on this site; collectively "we") may collect certain Usage Data that could potentially be used to contact or identify you. Usage Data are automatically collected when using this website.

When you visit this website, it is also visiting you. Because I don't maintain my own server, develop my own website framework, etc., I rely on third-party hosting and other service providers. Because of this, this site may bring several "friends" along, depending on how many ad networks and third-party data services these third parties use.

Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of this website that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you access this website by or through a mobile device, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiersn and other diagnostic data.

We may also collect information that Your browser sends whenever you visit this website or when you access it by or through a mobile device.

## Cookies

Each of these services may leave behind a little gift known as a cookie&mdash;a text file filled with inscrutable gibberish that allows various computers around the globe to identify you, including your preferences, browser settings, which parts of the site you visited, etc.

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on this website and store certain information. Tracking technologies used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze the website and/ or its hosting providers' services. The technologies we use may include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies.** A cookie is a small file placed on your device. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if You do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of this website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, this website may use cookies.

- **Web Beacons.** Certain sections of our website may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of a certain section and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.

Those same cookies may let our advertising and data broker partners track you across every other site you visit, then dump all of your information into a huge database attached to a unique ID number, which they may sell ad infinitum without ever notifying you or asking for permission.

## Data Retention

We store this information an indefinite amount of time for reasons even we don't fully understand. And when we do eventually get around to deleting it, you can bet it's still kicking around on some network backup drives in somebody's closet. So once we have it, there's really no getting it back. We canâ€™t even find our keys half the time&mdash;how do you expect us to keep track of this stuff?

## Not for Children

This website does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

## Security

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we've taken a little bit of effort to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Third Party Links

This website may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, security, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Disclosure of Data

We may disclose your data to third parties, and they in turn may further disclose it to others. We may also be compelled to disclose it for legal reasons.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy may change at any time, and the date it was last updated is indicated on this page.

## Conclusion

Remember, this is a tiny nonprofit website that is (barely) maintained in my (limited) free time&mdash;it is not a business. I don't personally want your data, but the (for-profit) third parties I partner with to host this site probably do. I don't have the time nor money to remedy this. If you don't like it, you probably shouldn't use the Internet.
