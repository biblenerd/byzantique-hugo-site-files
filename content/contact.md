Why would you want to? ðŸ˜› Just kidding: feel free to reach out&mdash;unless you're a jerk.

- <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0064\u0061\u006e\u0040\u0071\u006f\u0068\u0065\u006c\u0065\u0074\u002e\u0069\u006f';void 0">Email me</a>
- [Tweet @ me](https://twitter.com/qohelet_dan)

## Alternative email address

My email address is `qohelet_dot_dan_at_pm_dot_me`. Thereâ€™s no underscores in my actual email address.

### Why did you write your email address like that?

Because jerks write spam bots that troll the Internet looking for email addresses to send junk mail to. It also thwarts people who canâ€™t figure out how to swap out â€˜atâ€™ with â€˜@â€™ and â€˜dotâ€™ with a period, but Iâ€™m not so sure thatâ€™s a bad thing.
